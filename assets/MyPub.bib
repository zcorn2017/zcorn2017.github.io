  abstract = {Deep learning-based drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction methods have demonstrated strong performance; however, real-world applicability remains constrained by limited data diversity and modeling complexity. To address these challenges, we propose SCOPE-DTI, a unified framework combining a large-scale, balanced semi-inductive human DTI dataset with advanced deep learning modeling. Constructed from 13 public repositories, the SCOPE dataset expands data volume by up to 100-fold compared to common benchmarks such as the Human dataset. The SCOPE model integrates three-dimensional protein and compound representations, graph neural networks, and bilinear attention mechanisms to effectively capture cross domain interaction patterns, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various DTI prediction tasks. Additionally, SCOPE-DTI provides a user-friendly interface and database. We further validate its effectiveness by experimentally identifying anticancer targets of Ginsenoside Rh1. By offering comprehensive data, advanced modeling, and accessible tools, SCOPE-DTI accelerates drug discovery research.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3 -untranslated regions of target mRNAs, influencing various biological processes at the post-transcriptional level. Identifying miRNA transcription start sites (TSSs) and transcription factors’ (TFs) regulatory roles is crucial for elucidating miRNA function and transcriptional regulation. miRStart 2.0 integrates over 4500 highthroughput datasets across five data types, utilizing a multi-modal approach to annotate 28 828 putative TSSs for 1745 human and 1181 mouse miRNAs, supported by sequencing-based signals. Over 6 million tissue-specific TF–miRNA interactions, integrated from ChIP-seq data, are supplemented by DNase hypersensitivity and UCSC conservation data, with network visualizations. Our deep learning-based model outperforms existing tools in miRNA TSS prediction, achieving the most overlaps with both cell-specific and non-cell-specific validated TSSs. The userfriendly web interface and visualization tools make miRStart 2.0 easily accessible to researchers, enabling efficient identification of miRNA upstream regulatory elements in relation to their TSSs. This updated database provides systems-level insights into gene regulation and disease mechanisms, offering a valuable resource for translational research, facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and precision medicine strategies. miRStart 2.0 is now accessible at https://awi.cuhk.edu.cn/∼miRStart2.},
