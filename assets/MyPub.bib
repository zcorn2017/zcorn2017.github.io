  abstract = {Deep learning-based drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction methods have demonstrated strong performance; however, real-world applicability remains constrained by limited data diversity and modeling complexity. To address these challenges, we propose SCOPE-DTI, a unified framework combining a large-scale, balanced semi-inductive human DTI dataset with advanced deep learning modeling. Constructed from 13 public repositories, the SCOPE dataset expands data volume by up to 100-fold compared to common benchmarks such as the Human dataset. The SCOPE model integrates three-dimensional protein and compound representations, graph neural networks, and bilinear attention mechanisms to effectively capture cross domain interaction patterns, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various DTI prediction tasks. Additionally, SCOPE-DTI provides a user-friendly interface and database. We further validate its effectiveness by experimentally identifying anticancer targets of Ginsenoside Rh1. By offering comprehensive data, advanced modeling, and accessible tools, SCOPE-DTI accelerates drug discovery research.},

  abstract = {Background: Coagulation- and fibrinolysis-related genes (CFRGs) are involved in tumor progression. However, their regulatory mechanisms in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to search for genes related to coagulation and fibrinolytic systems in ccRCC and to investigate their potential role in tumor pathogenesis and progression. Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between ccRCC and control samples, as well as key module genes associated with ccRCC, were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas-Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (TCGA-KIRC) dataset. Differentially expressed CFRGs (DE-CFRGs) were identified by intersecting these DEGs with CFRGs. Prognostic genes were identified through univariate Cox, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and multivariate Cox analyses of DE-CFRGs. Additional independent prognostic and enrichment analyses were conducted, and potential therapeutic drugs were predicted. In addition, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to validate the expression of prognostic genes. Results: Sixteen DE-CFRGs were identified by intersecting 3,311 DEGs, 1,719 key module genes, and CFRGs. Four prognostic genes—TIMP1, RUNX1, BMP6, and PROS1—were found to be involved in complement and coagulation cascades and other functional pathways. The prognostic model demonstrated strong predictive power for ccRCC, with stage, risk score, and grade all correlating with prognosis. Additionally, 14 potential drugs, such as tamoxifen citrate and cytarabine, were predicted for therapeutic targeting of the identified prognostic genes. RT-qPCR confirmed that the expression levels of TIMP1, and RUNX1 were significantly upregulated in ccRCC samples, consistent with bioinformatics analysis. Conclusions: A prognostic model incorporating TIMP1, RUNX1, BMP6, and PROS1 was constructed, offering new insights for prognostic evaluation and therapeutic strategies in ccRCC.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3 -untranslated regions of target mRNAs, influencing various biological processes at the post-transcriptional level. Identifying miRNA transcription start sites (TSSs) and transcription factors’ (TFs) regulatory roles is crucial for elucidating miRNA function and transcriptional regulation. miRStart 2.0 integrates over 4500 highthroughput datasets across five data types, utilizing a multi-modal approach to annotate 28 828 putative TSSs for 1745 human and 1181 mouse miRNAs, supported by sequencing-based signals. Over 6 million tissue-specific TF–miRNA interactions, integrated from ChIP-seq data, are supplemented by DNase hypersensitivity and UCSC conservation data, with network visualizations. Our deep learning-based model outperforms existing tools in miRNA TSS prediction, achieving the most overlaps with both cell-specific and non-cell-specific validated TSSs. The userfriendly web interface and visualization tools make miRStart 2.0 easily accessible to researchers, enabling efficient identification of miRNA upstream regulatory elements in relation to their TSSs. This updated database provides systems-level insights into gene regulation and disease mechanisms, offering a valuable resource for translational research, facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets and precision medicine strategies. miRStart 2.0 is now accessible at https://awi.cuhk.edu.cn/∼miRStart2.},
